This project consists in an analysis of SGB4964, a species-level genome bin isolated from stool samples of which we do not have any known references yet.
This word have been done by Filippo Mirolo, Alessandro Pilli and me. Each one of us contributed in an equal way for the development of the project. Here you find the report and scripts that we produced to make this project possible.
